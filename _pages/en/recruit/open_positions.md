## We are always hiring.

We incubate, accelerate, and implement ideas that our team create internally.

We are passionate entrepreneurs who want to build our culture around our earliest employees.

If you want to build high performing technology in a fast growing start-up where the best idea wins, we want to meet you.

If you’re interested in playing a key role both in experimentation and in implementation, we’d love to work with you. 

We hope you apply to one of our open positions below.

For job roles and responsibilities, please see [Engineering Levels]({{ site.link_jd_salary }})。

We are lean and value speed. Therefore, we wish our all our engineers to know basic full stack development. We have a dedicated onboarding program to help front- and back- end engineers learn the basics of full stack end-to-end development to faciliate team work, understanding, and collaboration. For details, please see [Onboarding Training]({{ site.link_onboarding }})。

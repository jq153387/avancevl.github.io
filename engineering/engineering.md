# Communication

Please read [principles and best practices for effective communication.]({{ site.baseurl }}/principles/communication.html)

## Slack
Slack is the primary means of communication within teams at AVL. The main development-focused channels are:
* `#dev`
* `#dev-back-end`
* `#dev-front-end`
* `#devops`

## GitLab Project Backlog

All engineering tasks and features originate from a GitLab issues ticket. The ticket will describe the features list, deliverables, story points, priority, and relevant manager. GitLab (and JIRA) is the **primary software project management tool** used to manage software at our firm.

## 1-Week Sprints

Engineering JIRA issues are grouped into 1-week sprints. Each engineer, remote or otherwise, is responsible for completing all JIRA tasks in the sprint. Within each sprint, JIRA tasks are ranked by:
- High Priority
- Medium Priority
- Low Priority

## 1-Sprint Product Release Cycles

Product release cycles are organized around 1 sprint. At the end of every sprint, we should have released a new version of our product.

# Agile

## Three Laws of Agile

The three laws of Agile are thus:

1. The **Law of the Customer**—an obsession with delivering value to customers as the be-all and end-all of the organization.
1. The **Law of the Small Team**—a presumption that all work be carried out by small self -organizing teams, working in short cycles and focused on delivering value to customers—and
1. The **Law of the Network**—a continuing effort to obliterate bureaucracy and top-down hierarchy so that the firm operates as an interacting network of teams, all focused on working together to deliver increasing value to customers.

## Agile Manifesto

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

We follow these principles:
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
1. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
1. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
1. Business people and developers must worktogether daily throughout the project.
1. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
1. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
1. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
1. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
1. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
1. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
1. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
1. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

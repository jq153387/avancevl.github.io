Much our of product cycle is inspired by Michael Seibel on [**Product Development Cycle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzVvjKLdAbk){:target="_blank"}


## Process for Getting Product Out the Door
1. Release product every 2 weeks.
1. Someone in charge of product. They are responsible for making sure team meets product goals, and team got product out the door.
1. KPIs (new content, new users, retained users)

## Product Meeting

* Only one meeting, at the beginning of the product development cycle
* Meeting as long as it took to come to a decision / conclusion
* Whiteboard
  * new features
  * bugs
  * tests
* Every idea was written down, no idea was debated
* Assign easy, medium, hard
* Pick the hards first, then pick mediums, then pick easies
* Spec ideas out.

## Product Person

The product manager is responsible for:

* Don't change the spec.
* Don't change the features list.
* **No context switching after product meeting in the middle of 2 week product cycle.**

The focus after the product meeting is to get product out the door, nothing else.

## Testing

* Testing requirements are part of each product cycle's list

> **最短的產品開發巡迴是兩週：** 每兩週無論發生什麼事新的產品版本一定要上線。

> 我們團隊的產品流程是參考Michael Seibel的演講[**Product Development Cycle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzVvjKLdAbk){:target="_blank"}

## 產品開發流程

1. Release product every sprint (1 week).
1. Someone in charge of product. They are responsible for making sure team meets product goals, and team got product out the door.
1. KPIs (new content, new users, retained users)

## 產品會議

* Only one meeting, at the beginning of the product development cycle
* Meeting as long as it took to come to a decision / conclusion
* Whiteboard
  * new features
  * bugs
  * tests
* Every idea was written down, no idea was debated
* Assign easy, medium, hard
* Pick the hards first, then pick mediums, then pick easies
* Spec ideas out.

## 產品專員

The product manager is responsible for:

* Don't change the spec.
* Don't change the features list.
* **No changing the scope of the sprint after the sprint has started. No fake Agile.**
* **No context switching after product meeting in the middle of 1 sprint product cycle.**

The focus after the product meeting is to get product out the door, nothing else.

## 產品測試

* Testing requirements are part of each product cycle's list

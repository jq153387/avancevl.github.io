Notwithstanding the above, the party to whom Confidential Information was disclosed (the “Recipient”) shall not be in violation of this section with regard to a disclosure that was in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, provided that the Recipient provides the other party with prior written notice of such disclosure in order to permit the other party to seek confidential treatment of such information. Each party shall only permit access to Confidential Information of the other party to those of its employees or authorized representatives having a need to know and who have signed confidentiality agreements or are otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.

Therefore, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek a court order in any court of competent jurisdiction against acts of non- compliance by the Receiving Party (including, but not limited to, its or his or her: assistants, agents, principals, partners, employees, contractors, or subcontractors) in contravention of this Agreement, without the posting of bond or other security, if allowed, or in the amount of US$100.00 (or the lowest amount such court can allow), in addition to whatever other remedies the Party or Parties may have.

If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole and in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions. 

14. **Confidentiality and Assignment:** This Agreement and its terms shall be considered fully private and confidential.

19. Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the other pursuant to this Agreement or any product utilizing any such data to any country for which the local government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval.

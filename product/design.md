## Zeplin

* Export designs in one click
	* No need to change how you design, just export your file in one click using our Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma, Adobe Photoshop CC plugins.
* Generate development resources automatically
	* Select the platform you’re designing for and let Zeplin take care of the rest, generating accurate tailored specs, assets, css, and code snippets.

## GitLab Design Management

* Design Management allows you to upload design assets (wireframes, mockups, etc.) to GitLab issues and keep them stored in one single place, accessed by the Design Management’s page within an issue, giving product designers, product managers, and engineers a way to collaborate on designs over one single source of truth.
* You can easily share mock-ups of designs with your team, or visual regressions can be easily viewed and addressed.

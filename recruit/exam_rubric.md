## 考試結果如何被評估
* 考試的目的是用實際面準確的測量實力，題目跟工作上的應用類似。
* 你的考試成就會決定你的職位與薪資範圍。
	* 越多可**完整使用的功能**，分數越高。

### 我們重視：
1. **速度.** 多快速能架構好有各功能的網頁？
1. **品質.** 其他工程師很容易瞭解並維修你寫的程式碼？

### 我們會看：
1. 你的 web URL。
	1. 網頁是否可以使用，功能規格是依照指示。
	1. 實際做出來的項目少，但品質好。
1. 你的 GitHub/GitLab **Git Commits**（以後申請工作可使用）
	1. 我們會以你的 GitHub/GitLab 上的 git commit 上傳程式碼時間來檢查考試期間內是否完成。
	1. 你的**第一個 commit** 應該在考試開始時。應該是幾乎空白，只有基本的程式碼，一些簡單網頁的架構設置。
	1. 你應該大概**每30分鐘 commit 一次**，總共大約5個 commits。
	1. 你在 2.5 小時裡，需要用你的 commits 來**顯示你的進度**。你最後的 commit 不應該包含全部或大部分的程式碼。

## How You Will Be Evaluated
* Our exam is designed to be an accurate reflection of the type of work you will be doing at our fast growing, lean startup.
* Your Engineer Level (E0-10) and therefore salary package will be decided by the completeness of your web app and the quality of your work.
	* The more functional features you are able to complete on our checklist, the higher your engineering/salary level.

### We value:
1. **Speed.** How quickly can you build a working app with a list of features?
1. **Code Quality.** How easy is it for other engineers to maintain your app?

### We will look at:
1. Your live web app with features as described by the exam, hosted on your own computer.
	1. **Functional and working.** We value functional, working prototypes, so make sure your site is live and running before you move onto additional features. Before your exam date to save time, we recommend setting a blank single page site on your development machine accessible on the web. 
	1. **Quality over quantity.** We would rather you focus on fewer features that are working and bug-free, rather than a bunch of broken, buggy features. 
1. Your code, hosted on Github. (This can serve as a portfolio for your future interviews and resume.)
1. Your **Git Commits**
	1. We use git commit times on your Github/GitLab to check that all of your exam work was completed **during your scheduled exam period**.
	1. Your first commit should be at the start of your exam time. Your **first commit** should only be an almost blank, basic, starter code to get a webpage up and running, likley with some simple pre-built framework setup.
	1. You should **commit every 30-minute**, with a total around 5 commits overall.
	1. Your commits should **show your progress** in the 2.5hr. Your final commit should not contain all or most of your work.

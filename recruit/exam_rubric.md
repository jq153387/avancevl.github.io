## 考試結果如何被評估
* 考試的目的是用實際面準確的測量實力，題目跟工作上的應用類似。
* 你的考試成就會決定你的職位與薪資範圍。
	* 越多可**完整使用的功能**，分數越高。

### 我們重視：
1. **速度.** 多快速能架構好有各功能的網頁？
1. **品質.** 其他工程師很容易瞭解並維修你寫的程式碼？

### 我們會看：
1. 你的 web URL。
	1. 網頁是否可以使用，功能規格是依照指示。
	1. 實際做出來的項目少，但品質好。
1. 你的 GitHub/GitLab **Git Commits**（以後申請工作可使用）
	1. 我們會以你的 GitHub/GitLab 上的 git commit 上傳程式碼時間來檢查考試期間內是否完成。
	1. 你的**第一個 commit** 應該在考試開始時。應該是幾乎空白，只有基本的程式碼，一些簡單網頁的架構設置。
	1. 你應該大概**每30分鐘 commit 一次**，總共大約5個 commits。
	1. 你在 2.5 小時裡，需要用你的 commits 來**顯示你的進度**。你最後的 commit 不應該包含全部或大部分的程式碼。

## How You Will Be Evaluated
* Our exam is designed to be an accurate reflection of the type of work you will be doing at our fast growing, lean startup.
* Your Engineer Level (E0-10) and therefore salary package will be decided by the completeness of your web app and the quality of your work.
	* The more functional features you are able to complete on our checklist, the higher your engineering/salary level.

### We value:
1. **Speed.** How quickly can you build a working app with a list of features?
1. **Code Quality.** How easy is it for other engineers to maintain your app?

### We will look at:
1. Your live web app with features as described by the exam, hosted on your own computer.
	1. **Functional and working.** We value functional, working prototypes, so make sure your site is live and running before you move onto additional features. Before your exam date to save time, we recommend setting a blank single page site on your development machine accessible on the web. 
	1. **Quality over quantity.** We would rather you focus on fewer features that are working and bug-free, rather than a bunch of broken, buggy features. 
1. Your code, hosted on Github. (This can serve as a portfolio for your future interviews and resume.)
1. Your **Git Commits**
	1. We use git commit times on your Github/GitLab to check that all of your exam work was completed **during your scheduled exam period**.
	1. Your first commit should be at the start of your exam time. Your **first commit** should only be an almost blank, basic, starter code to get a webpage up and running, likley with some simple pre-built framework setup.
	1. You should **commit every 30-minute**, with a total around 5 commits overall.
	1. Your commits should **show your progress** in the 2.5hr. Your final commit should not contain all or most of your work. 

## Feature Rubric

* **Maximum Points** is the maximum number of points each feature is worth.
	* This will be listed on the actual exam.
	* Correlated with the difficulty of the problem.
* **Score Percentage** of feature based on submission quality.
	* For each feature, we will assign a score from 0% to 100%.
	* 0% is lowest possible score, 100% is highest possible score.
* **Total Points = (Maximum Points) x (Score Percentage)**
	* We sum up the total points scored for each feature to get the **Exam Total Points.**
* **Exam Total Points** = sum up points scored on all features
* **Exam Total Score = (Exam Total Points) / (Exam Maximum Points) * 100%**

```
// Per Feature
Total Points = (Maximum Points) x (Score Percentage)

// Exam Total
Exam Total Points = Sum for all features(Total Points)
Exam Total Score = (Exam Total Points) / (Exam Maximum Points) * 100%

```

### Lead Engineer (90-100%)
* **Zero bugs.**
	* Complete features and options, nothing missing.
	* All edges taken into account.
* **UI/UX.**
	* UI looks like a real finished, production-ready product, as good as a real competitor.
	* Intuitive and easy to use. We should have to ask you how to use a product.
	* Product looks beautiful, something we would love to use ourselves.
	* Responsive Web Design
* **Code Quality.** Code organization and style is perfect example of quality code.
	* Code style and organization be used as ** example for other engineers to follow.**
    * Easier for other engineers to read and understand.
    * Clear, consistent naming conventions for functions and variables.
* **Surprise Us.**
	* Some new method or way of doing something that we didn't know about before.

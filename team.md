# About us

We are a team of entrepreneurs from MIT and Stanford. We studied engineering as undergraduates and worked in the world of banking, tech, and consulting in New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, and Shanghai before building startups in Silicon Valley. We are now based in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taipei. We create, build, and implement experiments quickly for profitable ideas. We make useful software.


## Values

Our 5 values are:

1. **Results**
1. **Iteration**
1. **Transparency**
1. **Collaboration**
1. **Efficiency**

Our values govern how we behave. They describe our expectations from people we hire. They help guide us on how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making; they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager. 

* It is most important to focus on **Results**
* We trust **fast Iteration** and **radical Transperancy** will lead to Results. 
* Our emphasis on **Collaboration** and **Efficiency** distinguishes us from other companies.


## Secret Sauce
There are many factors contributing a startup's success. Below are five and how we at AVL excel in each:

1. **Timing**

	We cannot time the market, because nobody can predict the future. But we can minimize our risk and maximize our probability of success. We try to create a favorable future and get lucky.


2. **Idea**

	We are fact-based and driven by finding and solving the root cause. We are flat-structured and meritocratic without hierarchy, where the best ideas win. 

3. **Team**

	We only work with the best. Each of new hire is smarter than our last hire. We believe our team has waht it takes to execute quickly and methodically. 

4. **Business Model**

	We focus on profitablity, efficient user acqusition, and quick growth.

5. **Funding**

	We are currently self-funded. If you're interested in partnering or investing, please contact us.

## Cadence

We run our team according to the following rhythm: 

#### Agile Scrum / Day 
#### Sprint / Week
#### KPIs & 1-on-1's / Month
#### OKRs / Quarter 
#### Annual Plan / Year
#### Strategy / 3 years
#### Vision / 10 years
#### Mission / 30 years
#### Big Hairy Audacious Goal (BHAG)
<!-- Our BHAG is to become the most popular X for Y in Z industry. For this to happen, we need to be best are making A much more B. -->
